Raw ideas:

1. Stages of development - domain requirements, development, compilation, assemble, stripping 
2. Loss of information at every stage 
  - code : intention. editor
  - compile/assemble: comments, var names, func names, classes, structs, code removal via optimization. gcc
  - strip: readibility
  - final binary: just 1s, 0s

3. Rev engg: 

 Static tools:
  - kaitai
  - nm
  - strings
  - objdump
  - checksec

Disassemblers:
  - IDA pro
  - Binary Ninja
  - Angr management
  - ghidra
  - cutter


 Dyanamic tools:
  - ltrace, strace - trace lib/sys calls with different inputs
  - gdb debugging
